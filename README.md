## Introduction
Kannada Text Summarization is a project aimed at automatically generating concise and coherent summaries of Kannada text documents. The goal is to provide a tool that can help users quickly understand the main points of long Kannada texts.

## Features
- Summarize long Kannada texts into shorter, meaningful summaries.
- Supports both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques.
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting and summarizing text.
- Pre-trained models available for immediate use.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kannada-text-summarization.git
    cd kannada-text-summarization
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the pre-trained models (if applicable):**
    - Provide instructions or scripts to download any necessary models.

## Usage
To use the Kannada Text Summarization tool, follow these steps:

1. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Input the Kannada text you want to summarize:**
    - You can input text directly or upload a text file.

3. **Choose the summarization method:**
    - Select between extractive or abstractive summarization.

4. **Generate the summary:**
    - Click on the 'Summarize' button to get the summary.

5. **View and save the summary:**
    - The generated summary will be displayed on the screen. You can save it if needed.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the models includes a collection of Kannada texts from various sources. Details about the dataset can be found in the `data` directory.

## Model
This project uses state-of-the-art natural language processing models for summarization, including:
- Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
- Sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms

Detailed information about the models and their training can be found in the `models` directory.

## Results
The performance of the summarization models is evaluated using standard metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU scores. Detailed evaluation results are available in the `results` directory.
